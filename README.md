X-Api-Proj is a Tkinter-based GUI application that allows users to enter a location and search terms to retrieve tweets from within a 2-kilometer radius using the twitteraccess.py module. The tweets are visualized on a static Google Map, with markers showing the location of each tweet. If a tweet does not include geolocation data, a default marker is placed at the mapâ€™s center. The currently selected tweet is highlighted with a distinct marker. The interface displays the total number of tweets retrieved, provides clickable links to the tweets, and includes "Next" and "Back" buttons to navigate through the results.
